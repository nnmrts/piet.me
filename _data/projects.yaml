      These are my dotfiles. There are many like them. But these are mine.

      I live in the command line with zsh and vim. There's some good stuff here, some bad stuff, don't judge.

        I have a long history of spending too much time building a nice website and too little time writing content for it. This one is no exception! ðŸ™ˆ

        ~~This site is built with [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com), an easy-to-use static site generator. One of the things that drew me to middleman over [Jekyl](https://jekyllrb.com/) was the choice of templating language. I really enjoy ruby's native ERB templating.~~

        This site is built with [eleventy](https://11ty.dev), and easy-to-use static site generator.

        I'm currently using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) for hosting. I also run [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) for privacy friendly analytics.

        All in all, I'm pretty proud. Now I just need to write something more than twice a year. ðŸ˜›
