      These are my dotfiles. There are many like them. But these are mine.

      I live in the command line with zsh and vim. There's some good stuff here, some bad stuff, don't judge.

        I have a long history of spending too much time building a nice website and too little time writing content for it. This one is no exception! ðŸ™ˆ

        This site is build on [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com), an easy-to-use static site generator. One of the things that drew me to middleman over [Jekyl](https://jekyllrb.com/) was the choice of templating language. I really enjoy ruby's native ERB templating.

        I'm currently using [now.sh](https://now.sh) for hosting. I also run [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) for privacy friendly analytics.

        Everything I do involves tests, so I use [HTMLProofer](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-proofer) to test markup and links. As I do with most of my projects, I use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to automate testing and deployment.

        All in all, I'm pretty proud. Now I just need to write something more than twice a year. ðŸ˜›
