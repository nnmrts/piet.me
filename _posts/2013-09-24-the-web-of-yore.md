My first exposure to the internet was in the library at secondary school (I think I was 14). It wasn't really a class though. We were sent to the library in groups of 3 to go see this new thing you could do with computers. I remember using Netscape and browsing around a little.

Not much of a memory really. But I think it's important (and fascinating) to look back at where the web came from. I don't remember this myself, but there was a time when early directory websites might have a section for "New Websites Today" and it listed less than a dozen sites. (!!!) In 2012 there was an average of [130,000 websites added each day](http://royal.pingdom.com/2013/01/16/internet-2012-in-numbers/)!

I've been listening to The Web Behind series on [The Web Ahead](http://5by5.tv/webahead). The interviews with various long standing web people cover everything from CERN to the very first web browsers to the evolution of search engines. It's been pretty intriguing to listen to these web pioneers talk candidly about the early days.

I actually find it quite humbling to think about. In a time where it seems pretty limitless what you could do with the web, it's too easy to look back and just scoff at marquee tags, IE6 and using tables for layout. But that's not the important stuff to remember about the web of the past. The thing to remember is the way this thing (quite literally) changed the world. And that it was an environment of collaboration and experimentation that was the foundation for creating the web.

I've also been following [Jeremy Keith](http://adactio.com)'s recent involvement in a project to recreate the one of the first web browsers. [Check out Jeremy's post from his time in CERN](http://adactio.com/journal/6507/) where he shares a bunch of interesting links including the [first ever website](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html) (restored to it's original uri) and the result of their project.

The web can seem so impermanent sometimes. Just last week the first website I did with Daylight (two years ago) was replaced with a new one. I'm not sure that means much beyond illustrating how quickly things move on the web in comparison to the physical world. My home is 40 years old, my car is 10 years old.

Anyway, moving forward I have a lot more respect for the web of the past. I'll be thinking twice before I scoff at another table layout, or IE causing issues. I'll be thinking about how the web is a giant experiment that has issues but get's better everyday. And I'll be thinking about the fact that the atmosphere of collaboration and experimentation that was there at the beginning, still persists today.

If that isn't nice, I don't know what is.
