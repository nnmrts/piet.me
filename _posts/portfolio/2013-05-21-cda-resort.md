**Role:** Front-end developer with [Daylight](http://thedaylightstudio.com)

Coeur d' Alene Resort needed a site overhaul to replace their aging non-responsive site. We worked with the client to prioritize content and develop a content structure that would be effective at communicating the information no matter what the device size. I leaned heavily on CSS3 to impliment the user interactions accross the site. We were very pleased with the final result.
