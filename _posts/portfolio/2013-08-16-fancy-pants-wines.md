**Role:** Front-end developer with [Daylight](http://thedaylightstudio.com)

The client was launching a new brand of wine and needed to communicate the brand's fun and fancy style. This project was particularly enjoyable since we had the scope to experiment with inline svg images. There was also plenty of oppertunity to play with CSS3 to achieve the designers vision.
