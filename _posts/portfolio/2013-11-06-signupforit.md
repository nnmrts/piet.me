This is an itch I'm scratching. My friend and I belong to a church community where every week a clipboard and paper is passed around for people to sign up for various volunteer opportunities. For both the volunteers and the organizers the system is awkward and cumbersome. Signupfor.it is a friendly web app that will help organizers quickly set up sign up sheets, and for volunteers to quickly and easily sign up for stuff. 

The front-end is built on AngularJS which will interface with a Python based API.
