    Describing all the possible user flows and business logic of an application can become tricky. Ironically, user stories might not tell the whole story – they often leave out potential edge-cases or small yet important bits of information.

    However, one important (and very old) mathematical model of computation can be used for describing the behavior and all possible states of a user interface: the finite state machine.

    dedicated to the subject. But many of them propogated misunderstandings of Kent's
    original rules so that TDD practice bears little resemblance to Kent's original
    ideas. Key misunderstandings around what do I test, what is a unit test, and what
    is the 'public interface' have led to test suites that are brittle, hard to read,
    and do not support easy refactoring. In this talk we re-discover Kent's original
    proposition, discover where key misunderstandings occured and look at a better
    approach to TDD that supports sofware development instead of impeding it. Be prepared
    from some sacred cows to be slaughtered and fewer but better tests to be written,\n\n"

  extended: I struggled with how to think about complexity through much of my career,
    especially during the ten years I spent leading Office development. Modeling complexity
    impacted how we planned major releases, our technical strategy as we moved to
    new platforms, how we thought about the impact of new technologies, how we competed
    with Google Apps, how we thought about open source and throughout “frank and open”
    discussions with Bill Gates on our long term technical strategy for building the
    Office applications.

  description: Thinking of the next developer
  extended: Over the last year, I've ended up on four projects that were started prior
    to my arrival. This isn't uncommon; more often than not throughout any career
    in development, you'll find that you're spending a lot of time trying to understand
    someone else's code. It may have been written a few days ago, and it may have
    been written years ago. The original author may still be on-hand to talk you through
    it, or they may have moved on. But regardless of the circumstances, you will often
    find yourself spending time figuring out what a codebase you're looking at is
    doing, and why.

  extended: LISP. It conjures up visions of a bygone age of computers the size of
    refrigerators, ALL CAPS CODE, and parentheses. Oh! so many parentheses! So why
    is Object-Oriented Programming's creator so enamored with the idea of Lisp? And
    what can he mean by a programming language being an idea anyway? Should I blame
    my Computer Science education for not teaching it to me?

  extended: |-
    The vagueness and confusion around the phrase “full stack developer” has been lingering for years. Google it and you’ll find plenty of discussion about why it’s such a loaded term.
    Given that long-standing vagueness, labelling yourself as “full stack” might be doing you more harm than good, especially if you’re just starting out.
