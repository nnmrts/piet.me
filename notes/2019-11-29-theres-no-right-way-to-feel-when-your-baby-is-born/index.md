When my daughter was born I was so emotionally overwhelmed after a difficult birth. You hear so many stories about people “falling in love as soon as they held their new child”. I expected that, and when I didn’t feel that immediately it made me feel like I was a bad parent, in the first moment of holding my child!

People can give advice, but you know your child the best out of everyone in the world. Trust that first.
