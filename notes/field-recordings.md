A picture is worth a thousand words. But a sound can transport you to a moment or a space in a way that a two dimentional image can't. At least that's my experience. ☺️

Over the last few years I've recorded little moments in various spaces. There was something about the sound landscape in those spaces that captured my experience more vividly than a picture or video ever could.

So this is a space for me to gather and share those recordings.

## A few of my favourites
