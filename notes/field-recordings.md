Sound has a way of transporting me to a moment or a space in a way that an image can't.

Over the last few years I've recorded little moments in various spaces. There was something about the sound landscape in those spaces that captured my experience more vividly than a picture or video.

Here are a few of my favourites:

* [[/notes/martins-triathlon/|Mart√≠n's Triathlon]]
* [[/notes/summer-storm/|Summer Storm]]
* [[/notes/heartbeats/|Heartbeats]]
* [[/notes/paris-market|Paris Market]]
