Today is my last day at Cozy. ðŸ˜¢&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife and I are flying to the Netherlands to start a new adventure close to my Dutch family. I started at Cozy in January 2014 as a front-end engineer. I have an agency background, and after spending several years working on client websites, I was excited to have a chance to do something differentâ€Šâ€”â€Što work on one product with a cool team.

<!-- excerpt -->

I canâ€™t possibly write about all the things I learned while I was at Cozy; Iâ€™m trying to keep this short. But here are the things that stand out when I think about what I know now versus what I knew then:

## Process is fluid

One of my favorite things about working at Cozy is that we allowed our processes to evolve as our team and company evolved. No methodology is one-size-fits-all. In fact, most methods for organizing and prioritizing work donâ€™t match any team perfectly. So, rather than sticking to a process that didnâ€™t fit us, we developed our process to fit our needs as we grew. Try, tweak, repeat.

## Teams are like family

Sometimes you disagree. Sometimes you have arguments. And sometimes youâ€™re wrong. But thatâ€™s all OK. Tensions happen, but the end of the day youâ€™re still a team and you still have the same goal. Then you can drink beer together.

## Choice of work fosters ownership

At Cozy, engineers often have the opportunity to choose what to work on next. For me, this fostered a sense of ownership of my work. And with ownership comes pride, not just after the fact, but during the process of pushing yourself to produce excellent work.

## Always be learning

During my first year at Cozy, I was constantly learning and being exposed to new ideas and concepts I hadnâ€™t encountered before. I learned by just doing my job. But eventually that passive learning started to taper off.
At that point, I started reading technical books and articles during my bus ride to work. Those 20 minutes of reading each morning helped broaden my ideas about the work I was doing at Cozy, while making me a more well-rounded engineer.

## Fight with the tech you haveâ€¦

â€¦not the tech you want. New ways to build a product can be shiny and exciting. But often enough, you have existing code thatâ€™s doing a good job. Thereâ€™s no need to replace it wholesale when what you have fits your needs. If the way youâ€™re building your product seems like it isnâ€™t working in some way, try to evolve and improve it before throwing everything out. Thereâ€™s a lot of value in something your team knows how to use, something thatâ€™s worked in the past.

Iâ€™m super excited for the new adventure ahead of me, but Iâ€™m sad to be leaving Cozy. My time at Cozy has been formative, and itâ€™s been my absolute pleasure to work with such an amazing group of people. Iâ€™m gonna miss them. ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ˜¢
