I've been excited to hear more about initiatives like [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) and [Code.org](http://code.org/), which aim to make code a normal part of a child's education.

> Learning to code is an important skill now we’re living in a digital age. It’s not just enough for children to know how to use technology. They should know how it works too.

> Learning to code doesn’t just mean you can become a developer it strengthens problem solving skills and logical thinking and supports key academic subjects such as science, maths and technology.

> ~ Code Club

One of my favourite things about the internet is it's ability to empower people to learn and create, but I've never thought about how the code itself could also do that.

I'm excited to see how Code.org and Code Club progress. In particular I'd be interested to see if initiatives pop up here in Portland too.
