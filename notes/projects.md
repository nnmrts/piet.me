Here are a few of the projects I've built. Some are alright. ðŸ˜›

<!-- excerpt -->

## Command line

### [Git get](https://github.com/pietvanzoen/git-get)

Keep your cloned repos nice and neat in a `go get` esk directory tree. Read more here: [How I organize my cloned git projects](/blog/organizing-git-projects/).

### [Hint](https://github.com/pietvanzoen/hint)

A command line tool to help you remember those little nuggets of knowledge.

### [Secrets](https://github.com/pietvanzoen/secrets)

CLI for setting and getting secrets using MacOS's keychain.

### [Dotfiles](https://github.com/pietvanzoen/dotfiles)

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them. But these are mine.

I live in the command line with zsh and vim. There's some good stuff here, some bad stuff, don't judge.

## Websites

### [piet.me](https://github.com/pietvanzoen/piet.me)

I have a long history of spending too much time building a nice website and too little time writing content for it. This one is no exception! ðŸ™ˆ

~~This site is built with [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com), an easy-to-use static site generator. One of the things that drew me to middleman over [Jekyl](https://jekyllrb.com/) was the choice of templating language. I really enjoy ruby's native ERB templating.~~

This site is built with [eleventy](https://11ty.dev), and easy-to-use static site generator.

I'm currently using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) for hosting. I also run [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/) for privacy friendly analytics.

All in all, I'm pretty proud. Now I just need to write something more than twice a year. ðŸ˜›


### [piet.space](https://piet.space)

A little creative outlet of mine. This is a collection of field recordings I've made over the years.


### [Emergency Frida](https://emergencyfrida.com)

Cute kitten photos, stat! Because, let's face it, 2020 was a rough year and everyone deserves more cute cat photos.
