# About Piet


## The short version
Anglo/Dutch web developer at [YoungCapital](https://www.youngcapital.nl). Previously at [Usabilla](https://usabilla.com), [Cozy](https://cozy.co), and [Daylight Studio](http://thedaylightstudio.com/). I love the open web, test driven development, vim, and fries with mayo.

I live in the Netherlands with my wife [Keven](https://girlkeven.com/), my daughter Teddie, and Eskimo the cat.

## The long version
I have dabbled in web development since I was a teenager. My first website was a R.E.M fanpage called ‚ÄúR.E.M ‚ÄòR‚Äô US‚Äù, which is long lost (un)fortunately. The first time I got paid for web development was freelancing building brochure websites and Wordpress themes.

I quickly moved on to [Daylight Studio](https://thedaylightstudio.com), where I developed the foundation of my love for automation and all things web. Later at [Cozy](https://cozy.co) I was given the fantastic opportunity of developing their first static javascript web app from the ground up. It was at Cozy that I was first introduced to Test Driven Development, and the way I build software has never been the same since. In 2016 I started at [Usabilla](https://usabilla.com) where I honed my skills leading teams and teaching TDD.

Some time while at Cozy I developed a love for the command-line. After some false starts, I adopted Vim as my primary text-editor and I love it to this day. I keep a set of [dotfiles](https://github.com/pietvanzoen/dotfiles) that I‚Äôm constantly (perhaps too constantly) improving and I‚Äôve written a few command-line tools that no-one uses. (See [Projects](/projects).) I use iTerm2, zsh, tmux, and my colourscheme of choice is [solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/).

When I‚Äôm not working I‚Äôm being a husband to [Keven](https://girlkeven.com/) and papa to Teddie. I [collect vinyl](https://www.discogs.com/user/pvz/collection) and nerd out over headphones and keyboards.

I‚Äôm also passionate about the open web, team building, and a good cup of coffee.

Thanks for listening.
