I've never been big on New Years resolutions. I've always leaned towards a ’let my yes be yes, and let my no be no’ mindset, and I've never been confident in my ability to keep a resolution so making them just seemed disingenuous for me. But this year I feel different about it. Perhaps it's due to hitting the big 3-0. So here's what I'd like to focus on this year:

READMORE

1. **Reading:** As a friend put it, reading is a wonderful source of new ideas, and I need some new ideas. I find it too easy to get in a rut with learning just happening in the workplace. Not that workplace learning is bad by any means, but I feel like I need diversify my learning a little.
2. **Writing:** Writing is another great tool for learning. It forces you to solidify and document ideas. I've never been confident in writing, probably because I've never made myself do it regularly. So this is the year.
3. **Speaking:** Lastly, I would like to challenge myself to speaking at least once this year. Similarly to writing, speaking is a good way to solidify ideas and to share them. Also, I've never spoken publicly so I think it will be a good personal challenge. They say the first is the worst, so let's get that out of the way.

So there you go. If you feel so inclined, please help me by keeping me accountable. Also if you have any suggestions for good reading sources, please do share.

Happy new year!
