Our front end team at Usabilla had the amazing privilege to attend JSConf EU this year. It was a fantastic experience for us all and we came home having learned a ton. This is just a summary of my key take-aways from the conference. 

## Your site can (and should) be accessible

Whenever we think about accessibility on the web we tend to just think of it in terms of providing access to people with disabilities. In the talk from [Laura Carvajal](https://twitter.com/lc512k) from [FT.com](https://www.ft.com/), Laura suggested we reframe this idea into providing fair access to all. Our job is to build tools for all our users, not just those that engage with the web the same way we do. 

15% of all internet users have some form of disability. After research FT.com found that 26% of their users had some form of disability. Considering that we go to great lengths to support users on a wide range of browsers, some of which have <5% usership, its only consistent that we support tools that potentially a quarter of our users use. 

Tools like [pa11ly](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pa11y) are a great way to ensure your site is [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) compliment, but that only covers about 35% of accessibility issues. Another way to highlight accessibility issues is to get an accessibility audit. Laura showed a enlightening video from people who face various accessibility issues. Issues that you would never think were immediately apparent. This kind of insight is invaluable. 

One more way to gain more insight, ditch the mouse. Many internet users (normally visually impaired) only use a keyboard to interact with the web. To really understand what these users experience Laura and her team got rid of their mice and went keyboard only.

## Getting out of our performance bubble

I'm gonna go ahead and say that [Ben Schwarzx](https://twitter.com/benschwarz) From [Calibre](https://calibreapp.com/) has coined the phrase Wealthy Western Web to describe the web that most of us develop in. We work on €2000+ computers on 100 Mbit/s fiber. Even on mobile we're often working with high end devices on 20 Mbit/s LTE connections. The World Wide Web is a very different picture. The average device is about 5x slower than our laptops and 60% of the world are on 2g mobile data connections. 

There are a number of ways to start testing the performance of our apps against devices that most people use. Calibre's platform and Google Lighthouse provide people centric metrics for web app performance. Specifically Time to First Interaction is a much better metric for app performance than say page load time because it considers the time it takes for the device to parse the application and render it to a point that it's usable. A 400 kb gzipped bundle is nice and small to download but once uncompressed the device has to handle several megabytes of code. 

There were lots of talks about performance optimisation at JSConf. But without metrics to judge against you have no idea how effective your optimisations are and if you're optimising the right thing. I'm really looking forward to giving Calibre a shot after chatting with Ben.

## A new bar for conferences

JSConfEU was the best conference I have ever attended. First off, it achieved everything you would want from any conference. Amazing speakers, amazing topics, amazing community, amazing execution. The venue was beautiful, the day to day flow of things was almost flawless, the food was amazing and they managed to serve 900+ people within 20 minutes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. 

But wait there's more.

The speakers were 50/50 men/women. Not all white. All food was vegetarian friendly, vegan friendly, and high quality. (I'm neither of these but loved the food.) They provided childcare. Gender neutral restrooms. Gender badges. Scholarships. Drinks provided in glass bottles over plastic.

JSConfEU as an excellent example of what a conference should look like. Diverse, inclusive, and shamelessly advocating for those things.

## Final Words

Building amazing tools and events for that are accessible to all people is achievable if you prioritise it. And you should because it's just the right thing to do, and if you need another reason, you should because it benefits everyone. 

Making code performant for the average device improves performance on all devices. Making apps work for all platforms (browsers, screen readers, keyboards) results in a better user experience for all. Continuously striving to provide spaces (physical or digital) accessible to all people make your communities more cohesive and wiser. 

The talks and the conference itself was an eye opening example as to what events and the web could be, and it's an awesome picture. There are lots of hard problems to solve, but that's what we as developers signed up for, to solve hard problems. Let's do it. 

## Final Final Words… Thank you

First, thanks to all the organisers and speakers at JSConf for putting on an amazing and inspiring event.

I also want to thank [Usabilla](https://usabilla.com/) for giving us the opportunity to attend. The company paid for our flights, accommodation, and the conference fees. I'm well aware that without a company that prioritises all the points above I probably would not have been able to attend.
