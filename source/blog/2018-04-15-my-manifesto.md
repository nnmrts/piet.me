title: My professional manifesto
---

My key software engineering values:
* Zero friction development workflow.
* Solve the problem you have now.
* Choose the right tool for the right job.
* Maximize reliability.

Software is about people first
* code is for people
* should be as readable as possible
* reduce friction, save energy and motivation

Solving the problems you have now
* Think hard about what problem you're trying to solve now
* Don't shoot your future self in the foot, but where possible delay implimenting solutions to problems you don't have yet

Balance the size of the tool with the size of the problem
* Often, simple solutions go with simple problems
* Use the appropriately sized tool for the job

Reduce long term friction
* 

Maximise reliability
* Solve a problem once, and ensure it stays solved
*
