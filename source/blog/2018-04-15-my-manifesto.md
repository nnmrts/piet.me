title: My professional manifesto
---

My key software engineering values:
* Zero friction development workflow.
* Solve the problem you have now.
* Choose the right tool for the right job.
* Maximize reliability.

Software is about people first:
* code is for people
* should be as readable as possible
* reduce friction, save energy and motivation
* automate what you can
* remove distractions

Solving the problems you have now
* Think hard about what problem you're trying to solve now
* Don't shoot your future self in the foot, but where possible delay implimenting solutions to problems you don't have yet
* Does not mean adding tech debt
* Open/Closed

Balance the size of the tool with the size of the problem
* Often, simple solutions go with simple problems
* Use the appropriately sized tool for the job

Maximise reliability
* Solve a problem once, and ensure it stays solved
* Put checks in place along the deployment process that everything still works
* Automate tests

Conclusion
* Won't you be my neighbour?
* Save your energy, you only have so much of it.
