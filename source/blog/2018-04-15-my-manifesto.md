title: My professional manifesto
---

There are some key values that I operate with in my day-to-day work. They guide most of my prioritization decisions. I thought it might be valuable to share them, and also to document them for my own awareness.

My key professional values (in no particular order):
* Strive for a zero friction workflow.
* Solve the problem you have now.
* Choose the right tool for the right job.
* Maximize software reliability.

## A zero friction workflow

Our primary task as developers is shipping value for our users. There's a lot of work involved in achieving that and along the way there are various tasks or issues that can come up which slow us down.

For example: Say you have one flaky test. Nine times out of ten it runs fine, but that tenth time something happens and it fails. Everytime it does you think "ugh, I need to fix that" and run the tests again and it passes. Not only is that flaky test taking time and energy away from you when it fails, it distracts you from your workflow. This might seem like a small distraction but over time their impact on our energy levels and motivation can be significant.

Another example. Excessive styling considerations. It's a common practice to to set standards for style of code and commit messages. These are valuable to ensure that our code consistent and



What I mean by 'friction' is anything that takes your energy away from your primary task of shipping value.



* Friction is anything that takes energy away from your primary task, shipping features.
* You only have so much energy in a work day. Be efficient with it.
* Things like: repetitive menial tasks, excessive styling considerations, manual deployment process, broken/flaky testing setup.

```
Software is about people first:
* code is for people
* should be as readable as possible
* reduce friction, save energy and motivation
* automate what you can
* remove distractions
```

## Solving the problems you have now
* Think hard about what problem you're trying to solve now
* Don't shoot your future self in the foot, but where possible delay implimenting solutions to problems you don't have yet
* Does not mean adding tech debt
* Open/Closed

## Balance the size of the tool with the size of the problem
* Often, simple solutions go with simple problems
* Use the appropriately sized tool for the job

## Maximise reliability
* Solve a problem once, and ensure it stays solved
* Put checks in place along the deployment process that everything still works
* Automate tests

Conclusion
* Won't you be my neighbour?
* Save your energy, you only have so much of it.

At the heart of these values are two key ideas I hold even more dearly. One: Be neighbourly. Two: We all have only so much energy in our days/months/years/lives. I think we can agree that we'd all rather not be spending it on things that could be automated, or are just unneccessary.
