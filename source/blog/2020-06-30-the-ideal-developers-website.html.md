How should the ideal developer present themselves publicly online? More specifically, what should the website of the ideal developer look like?

For the longest time, I’ve struggled with this question. Even spending a short time within the industry, you quickly learn that the ideal developer is one who speaks at conferences, tweets daily, blogs weekly, and has a handful of popular open-source projects to maintain. All this should be done while contributing to software at their full time paid gig. In this context, I’ve tried to build a website that alludes that I might share some qualities with this ‘ideal developer’.

At the same time, I am a strong proponent in people owning their own personal space on the internet. A space where they can express their interests and who they are as they please. Piet.me is my space. It’s gone through dozens of iterations as I learned new things and experimented with those learnings. But this has mostly been the skin and the form of the website. The content - the part that really represents who I am, what I do, and how I do it - has been lacking. But why? It is not for lack of trying. I have a dozen attempts at posts in various draft stages. They all stalled as I struggled to make them fit the brand of the ‘ideal developer’ that I thought I should present.

I read an article recently about how artists often augment their art to fit the ‘attention economy’ of social media platforms. The author describes how platforms like Instagram have pushed artists to build a brand for their artistic persona that encourages loyalty and attention. The author argues that this process has resulted in artists sacrificing the human side of their art for the sake of building a professional-looking brand.

> When the system tries to hack you, why not try to hack it back? Rather than obtaining the perfect surface of your professional selfie, here it might be interesting to turn yourself into a more human creature again. Art has been full of those stories showing _alternative ways_, and while we adore these stories from the past we do tend more and more to annihilate those stories when they’re happening around us. […] Our ideas of professionalism have become distorted, as it only presents a surface of boxes that are checked to give an easy read.

For me, this speaks to my long term struggle building a website that presents the correct brand. The thing is, I am not the ideal developer. I’m a human developer and Piet.me is my space. Inspired by all this, I am challenging myself to reclaim _my_ space. Let it be me as I am to the best of my abilities. Let it be the human me, not just the professional me. I hope this means I feel more comfortable posting less refined and (god forbid) non-technical content. I will still endeavour to share knowledge and learnings because I do believe these are excellent things to do! But I would like to pepper in more of me that is not the developer.

As a person who builds things on the internet for their profession, it’s been easy to feel that my website should always be a business card and resume. Highlighting my career strengths and achievements and letting potential recruiters or employers know I’m still relevant. But I would really rather have it be more human than that. Ultimately, having this space be mine is more important to me than it being a developer’s brochure. So let’s give that a shot shall we? More soon.
